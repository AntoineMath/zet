# Elon Musk's 5 step process for making things  
1. **Make the requirements less dumb**: the requirements must be questioned, especially if a smart person gave them to you as you might not question them enough.  
2. **Delete the part or the process step** : you can make an incase argument for anything.  
3. **Simplify and optimize** : only in the 3rd position because a common error is to optimize something that should not exist.  
4. **Accelerate cycle time**: go faster.  
5. **Automate**
