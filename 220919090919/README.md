# Light > dark mode
During the day, light mode is more easy on the eyes. It is way easier to read black text on a white screen than white text on a dark screen.
* When deem light, the pupil has too open and *muscles have to contract*.
* When bright light , the pupil too close and *muscles are relaxed*.
[wikipedia explanation][1]

Also, bright text on a dark screen has a little blur effect.
