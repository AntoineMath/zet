# My skin care routine  
- adapalene cream: Differin 0.1% (or generic). Better than other retinoid cream (no irritation)  
- Daily SPF cream: ?? (soon)   
- (hyaluronic supplement) (maybe soon)

### How to chose ?   
1. Take a mineral protection (not a chemical).  
  
2. Avoid those ingredients (according to https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/):   
-   Oxybenzone  
-   Octinoxate (Octyl methoxycinnamate)    
-   Homosalate  
-   Octisalate  
-   Octocrylene  
- Propylparaben (perturbateur endocrinien)  
- Phenoxyethanol (hématotoxique et hépatotoxique)  
  
3. A good way to know if composition is safe is by looking at https://www.quechoisir.org/  or english equivalent website.
